# Swipe_Wipe
Developed a swipe-based image classification app that lets users “swipe” left or right to sort or delete photos efficiently using an intuitive interface.


Swipe Wipe is an interactive photo management tool designed for fast and simple image sorting. Users can intuitively swipe left or right to organize, keep, or delete images. Built using Python and OpenCV with an emphasis on clean UI and responsive interaction, the app combines gesture-style controls with efficient image handling to streamline photo cleanup.
